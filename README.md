💊 Al-Salamah Pharmacy Management System (My First Original Project)
This is a special project for me. I built this CRUD System from scratch to solve a real-life problem I faced while working at a pharmacy. I needed a more efficient way to track medicine stock, expiry dates, and prices than using a traditional paper notebook—so I built one!

⏳ The Backstory
Built in: 7 / 2025.

The Inspiration: Real-world pharmacy work experience.

Legacy: This was my final "Grand Finale" with Pure JavaScript and CSS before moving on to React and Material UI.

🛠️ Key Features (Built with Logic)
This system isn't just a table; it's a fully functional management tool:

Complete CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete medicine records.

Smart Data Persistence: Uses localStorage so the pharmacy data isn't lost when the browser is closed or refreshed.

Advanced Search: Toggle between searching by Medicine Name or Company Name.

Smart Validation:

Prevents negative prices or counts (because "WTF" as my code says! 😂).

Validates expiry years (2000–2075).

Handles "Count" logic: Deleting an item reduces the count by 1 instead of removing the whole row, unless it's the last one.

Total Management: A "Delete All" button to reset the warehouse data in one click.

🎨 Design & UI
Custom CSS Animations: I created a dynamic glowing shadow effect using CSS @keyframes.

Fully Responsive: I spent a lot of time on @media queries to make sure the table is readable on mobile devices during work.

UX Enhancements: Includes a "Scroll to Top" button and automatic focus on search fields.

🧠 Reflection
Writing the logic for the update mode vs. create mode and handling the localStorage sync taught me more about JavaScript than any tutorial ever could. It was the perfect bridge to my current journey with React.

Note: I used AI to help craft this README because it translates the passion I have for this project into clear English!
